This is rBuild, the unified interface for Conary, rMake,
and rBuilder.  The purpose of this tool is to provide a single,
unified, and fully-documented interface (command line and Python
API) to developers using rPath technologies, using an extensible
plugin framework.

A shell script written using the command-line interface should be
relatively easy to transform to a Python program that uses the Python
API.  You can provide your own plugins that follow the same model.

Note that until version 1.0 is released, public APIs are subject to
change.  All documentation regarding stable interfaces is relevant
only to published stable releases; it is not in force for alpha
and beta releases, including 0.x releases and any automated builds.
